# Augmented Reality Solar System

This is a fun toy app which explores the capabilities of ARKit. The heavy lifting is done by SceneKit but the possibilities for exploring the world(s) are endless and exciting.

The app can be run either in ARKit with the `SolarSystem` target and requires the user to find an `ARAnchorPlane`:

 It can also be run in a SceneKit View with a black background using the `SolarSystemScene` target:

The ARKit is much more interactive, while the SCNView is much more debuggable.

### Layers

Earth Layers were found here: https://www.blenderguru.com/tutorials/create-a-realistic-earth and they look pretty slick up close.
